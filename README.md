About: 
------

This application is part of a project designed using the United States Digital Services playbook. This is the web component of a inter-agency initiative to properly validate criminal records and emit proper good standing certificates.  

The application benefits include:
- responsive web application (adapts to different screen sizes, including mobile phones) 
- user email validation and confirmation 
- simplified multi-page form
- integration with the Government Messaging Queue (GMQ) API

Install:
-------

Configure your dotenv (.env) file: 
In the root folder, copy env.txt to .env and edit it, to customize it with your settings.  

This server utilizes the lightning fast Redis database for storing user session information. You must install redis (http://redis.io) and run it before running this software. Simply install redis, and edit the configuration file to set an authentication password to redis, then provide this information on your .env file.  

Assuming you've installed ruby 2 and gems and customized your dotenv file, here's how you start the server:
- bundle install
- foreman start
