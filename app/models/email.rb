# A class that represents emails in the storage.
# Email addresses are validated by sending an email to the user.
# Once an email has been validated as a delivery mechanism, we can
# confirm it by using this class.

    # a resend of an email to confirm their address. This
    # is to give time to the mail server to empty its queue.
