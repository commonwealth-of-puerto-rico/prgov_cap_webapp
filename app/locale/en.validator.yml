                  If the certificate you wish to validate contains as its
                  identification number a social security number, know that
                  you will be required to have the full
                  8 digits of that number in order to proceed with the
                  validation. If you do not have this number, we recommend
                  you request the SSN identification with the information from the
                  owner of the certificate. This is a security measure to protect
                  you against counterfeit certificates.
