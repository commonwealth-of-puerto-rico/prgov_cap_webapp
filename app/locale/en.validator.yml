            A certificate with that application number, %{id}, could not be
            found. It may have expired or never existed. A certificate
            with that application number should not be accepted.
        error: |
            A certificate with that number *was found*, *but* the
            information supplied *did not match*. Please try again and
            make sure you've properly entered the identification numbers.

            If after confirming you've the entered the information exactly
            as it apperas in the certificate, the information still does
            not match, you should not accept the certificate as it may
            be invalid, contain errors in our systems or may even be an
            attempt at fraud.

            This attempt has been logged. If you believe this certicate
            may be a fraud or contain errors, we kindly request you report
            it to the Puerto Rico Police Department.
