        Download the first official PR.Gov native app for https://appsto.re/us/KyA_6.i[iPhones],
        https://appsto.re/us/KyA_6.i[iPads] and
        https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=PR.Gov[Androids].
        With it you may request and validate the New Good
        Standing Certificates from the Police Department of Puerto Rico.

        With this app you may also safely scan QR-codes from PR.Gov to access
        a variety of new services as they become available, as the app makes
        sure to scan and only open https secure services of the official
        government domain (pr.gov) of the government of Puerto Rico.

        In this way, this app can help you detect fraud when validating
        documents and protect you by only accessing official government
        validation addresses securely, and refusing non-government ones.

        This app is not necessary to request a certificate or validate it as
        all of these things may be done via the web, however, it makes it much
        more easier so we are offering for both iOS and Android platforms.
