        Hello,

        We've received an online petition so this email address can
        access the new Good Standing Certificate Request of the Puerto Rico Police
        Department.

        Assisting you through this process is important to us. First
        we will guide you through completing your request. Afterwards we
        will proceed to verify the submission information against
        multiple law & orden government systems to validate any existing
        criminal records. We will keep you duly informed during this process.

        To confirm your email and proceed to the form, please click the following
        link or visit the following address:

        If you believe you've received this mail in error, we apologize and
        request you delete and ignore it.
